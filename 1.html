  <h4>1장</h4>
  1 In the beginning <strong><u>God</u> created the heavens and the earth.</strong><br><br>

  <p>2 Now the earth was formless and desolate, and there was darkness upon the surface of the watery deep,
  and God’s active force was moving about over the surface of the waters.
  3 And God said: <strong>“Let there be light.”</strong> Then there was light.
  4 After that God saw that the light was good, and God began to divide the light from the darkness.
  5 God called the light Day, but the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day.

  6 Then God said: <strong>“Let there be an expanse between the waters,
  and let there be a division between the waters and the waters.”</strong>
  7 Then God went on to make the expanse and divided the waters beneath the expanse from the waters above the expanse.
  And it was so.
  8 God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.<p>
